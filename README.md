# TwoLayerNNWithLasagne
Simple two layer neural network with Theano and Lasagne to do handwritten digit recognition.

Tried to train a simple 2 layer network with no minibatch. Got around 93% test accuracy after 500 epochs. Will run it longer and update the results as the current results are not very impressive.
